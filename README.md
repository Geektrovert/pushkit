# Push notification the hard way

Mostly independent (still depends on the browser delivery channel) push notification for the web. 

## How to use

You can use this version if you do some hard work of reading through the source code in the project. I'm already working on proper documentation

## How to develop

Simple, Look into the `package.json` file. If you can figure out it's content, I don't think I need to explain anything else.

## WORK IN PROGRESS

Make sure you know what you are doing before trying to use it in production or anything close to production.
